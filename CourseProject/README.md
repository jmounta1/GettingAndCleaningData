# Readme for "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project
## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to develop a script called "run_analysis.R" that would collect accelerometer data from a Samsung phone
dataset and tidy it up. The accelerometer data is split into multiple files, so the script first loads all the individual files and merges
the datasets. The script also creates a final tidy dataset that contains averages for values in the original dataset, subsetted for
each activity performed by each subject. The final dataset can be found in "Samsung_Data_Tidy.txt". The process is explained in more detail
in the "Codebook.md" file.
