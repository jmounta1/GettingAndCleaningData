#Codebook for "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project

##Data
The data used in this analysis all comes from Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, and Xavier Parra in the UCI HAR Dataset. Further documentation on this dataset can be found [here.](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#) The purpose of this script `run_analysis.R` was to average the values of several variables described below based on `Subject` and `Activity` of the participants in the experiment, then output these averaged values to a tidy dataset that I called `Samsung_Data_Tidy.txt`.
